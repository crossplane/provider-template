# provider-template

`provider-template` is a minimal [Crossplane](https://crossplane.io/) Provider
that is meant to be used as a template for implementing new Providers. It comes
with the following features that are meant to be refactored:

- A `ProviderConfig` type that only points to a credentials `Secret`.
- A `MyType` resource type that serves as an example managed resource.
- A managed resource controller that reconciles `MyType` objects and simply
  prints their configuration in its `Observe` method.

## Developing

1. Use this repository as a template to create a new one.
1. Run `make submodules` to initialize the "build" Make submodule we use for CI/CD.
1. Rename the provider by running the follwing command:
```
  make provider.prepare provider={PascalProviderName}
```
4. Add your new type by running the following command:
```
make provider.addtype provider={PascalProviderName} group={group} kind={type}
```
5. Replace the *sample* group with your new group in apis/{provider}.go
5. Replace the *mytype* type with your new type in internal/controller/{provider}.go
5. Replace the default controller and ProviderConfig implementations with your own
5. Run `make reviewable` to run code generation, linters, and tests.
5. Run `make build` to build the provider.
